A simple skeleton for implementing a bowling scoring algorithm. 

One of my favorite pairing-interview questions. 

If you are unfamiliar with the rules of scoring bowling, they are as follows:

- The game has ten frames. The object in each frame is to knock down the ten pins.
- Each frame has two throws
- The user's basic score for a frame is the total of two throws.
- If the user knocks down all ten pins on the first throw of a frame that is a strike. The score for that frame includes the strike, plus the score for the next two throws. 
- If the user knocks down all ten pins with both shots in the frame, that is a spare. The score for that frame includes the ten points for the spare, plus the pins knocked down in the next throw. 
- If the user gets a strike in the tenth frame, the user takes two additional shots to get
added to the score. If the user gets a spare in the tenth frame, the user gets one
additional shot to be added to the score. 
- By the above rules, a perfect game has a score of 300.
